10:45 Added forced dropout and xavierimproved weights to net, previous error "Your top-5 error is 0.353 and top-1 error is 0.651."

Ideas: 

Average pooling - why?
Prelu
Changing learning rate and momentum
Increasing channels
Larger augmentations, rotations (few degrees)
Jittering images with noise
Add inputs with frequencies, fourier transform, power spectrum
L1, L2 regularization
Sub-batches?
Euclidean loss
